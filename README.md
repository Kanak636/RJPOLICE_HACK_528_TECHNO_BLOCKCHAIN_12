Our Solution :
Better Visualization Software : Arkham Intelligence
Using this software we can see the fully onchain data of any crypto user if 
the user withdraw their fund from any exchange to the private wallet we 
can use arkhm s own API to make our system software
We can visually show the onchain data in a systematic manner and tracking the 
onchain activity 
This can be very beneficial for us to integrate in our system
Second Plateform is DEBANK :
Just like simple bank we can track the wallet address fund where he stores 
we integrate this plateform in our software 
From this we can trac the users fund activity
Next we use exchange API :
Every crypto users have to buy the coins from the exchanges we can identifiy 
the user activity on exchanges through the API and Exchanges have to verify 
the users kyc verification using the national id 
Next Step :
We have to combine all this in our software and then we make the our software 
fully secured and easy to understand 
working in india the user must have to complete there users kyc is completed.
